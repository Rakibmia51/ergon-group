    <h1>Empowerment</h1>
    <div class="safety-content">
     <br>
      <p>SQUARE Group is involved in various community development programs. These programs aim 
        to achieve the socio-economic freedom of rural women, empower underprivileged people, 
        and develop the skills and competency of unemployed youths. SQUARE also keeps a constant
         focus on the emerging scopes in society to come forward with more assistance.</p><br>
             <img src="images/employee wellbeing/Employee-img-1.jpg" alt="">

             <br><br>
             <p><b>Socio-Economic Freedom of Rural Women</b></p>
             <p>SQUARE partners with NGO known as JITA by providing SQUARE’s consumer goods at trade price in order 
              to support rural women running last-mile distribution networks. These entrepreneurial projects supply 
              quality essential consumer goods, promote better health, hygiene and nutrition, and create supplemental
               incomes for them in the process. JITA activates micro-entrepreneurs to run JITA Hubs (stockiest points),
                from where goods reach the hands of rural consumers through a wide network of micro-merchants and women 
                door-to-door sales agents called Aparajitas (means “women who do not accept defeat”). More than 300 
                women are being trained and recruited as Aparajita whose are responsible of selling SQUARE Toiletries
                 products such as Meril Petroleum Jelly, Meril Beauty Soap, Chaka Ball Soap, Revive shampoo, Jui
                  coconut oil etc. in their local community. This will eventually help them (Aparajita) to
                   make a better living by earning revenue from selling STL Products.</p>

             <br><br>
            <p><b>Basak Leaf Cultivation</b></p><br>
            <p>In collaboration with NGOs, SQUARE trains marginal people in the rural area on how to
               cultivate medicinal plant-like ‘Basak’ which again SQUARE buys back from them with a 
               high average market price. Cultivators, having no land of their own, are assisted to 
               utilize unused land on the road flanks and pond banks. SQUARE also facilitates them with 
               warehousing, sales point, and transportation. More than 40,000 men and women are now 
               directly involved in the production. These leaves are used as raw material for producing 
               one of the most popular, effective, sugar-free, non-sedating herbal cough syrups.</p>

          <br><br>
            <p><b>Dishari Computer Training Institute</b></p><br>
            <p>SQUARE runs a computer training institute in one of its business districts with an 
              aim to develop ICT skills and competencies of unemployed youth from the community. 
              The institute provides 100% scholarships to the students. Training helps them to get 
              a suitable job or start their own small ventures. An average of 500 students passes 
              out from this institute every year when around 40% of them are female.</p>
